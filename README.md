# gifme
Gifme is a super-simple Ruby and JS app for grabbing, previewing, and linking to individual files
in a directory of images. Namely, animated gifs.

## Why would you do this
I wanted to be able to search my gif library and do so in a way more fancy/interesting than CMD+F.
I also wanted previews that were bandwidth-friendly, and (eventually) a tagging system with both
global and local tags.
